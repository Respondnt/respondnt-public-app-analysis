If the compromised account has admin or owner privileges in a paid or Enterprise-tier tenant, the attacker’s visibility expands substantially: they can use admin consoles, Admin and SCIM APIs, and Audit Logs/Legal Holds to build complete maps of users, roles, groups, workspaces, apps, workflows, and Slack Connect trust relationships, as well as to understand security, retention, export, EKM, data residency, and authentication/MFA policies. Public status and trust documentation further reveal Slack’s underlying cloud services and operational model. Environment constraints like MFA Required, SSO-Only Authentication, Admin Approval Required, IP Allowlisting, and Rate Limiting do little to impede post-compromise discovery, but they influence how stealthily the attacker must perform API-based enumeration and may limit where those API calls can originate."

        "summary": "From the position of a compromised, already-trusted Slack app, the attacker can perform substantial Discovery using only documented APIs and features, without needing additional credentials or UI access. Concretely:\n\n- **Cloud Account discovery** is achievable by enumerating Slack users via Web API user-listing methods, SCIM APIs (where granted), Audit Logs, and Events API streams. This yields a rich inventory of internal users, service accounts, guests, and external Slack Connect participants, along with basic roles and identity attributes.\n\n- **Cloud Groups / permission structures** can be mapped by listing channels (including Slack Connect shared channels), retrieving membership for each, enumerating SCIM groups and admin/owner roles, and correlating this with Slack Connect metadata and audit events. The attacker can reconstruct who has access to which collaboration spaces and where cross-tenant trust boundaries exist.\n\n- **Cloud Service discovery** is feasible by inspecting the app’s granted scopes and probing admin, governance, SCIM, workflow, marketplace, AI/agent, and status APIs. This reveals which Slack enterprise features (Audit Logs, Legal Holds, SCIM, AI agents, Workflow Builder, etc.) are enabled, which third-party and internal apps are installed, and how Slack is tied into the victim’s broader SaaS and identity ecosystem.\n\n- **Password Policy Discovery** and **Cloud Service Dashboard** techniques are **not** directly achievable from this foothold: Slack does not expose password policies to apps, and the attacker lacks interactive user/admin credentials to exploit GUI dashboards. \n\nEnvironmental constraints such as MFA, SSO-only authentication, domain-based registration, CAPTCHA, and admin approval mainly harden initial access but do not prevent discovery via the already-issued OAuth tokens. The primary practical constraints on these discovery vectors are Slack’s API rate limits, potential IP allowlisting around the compromised vendor’s infrastructure, and the visibility created in customer audit logs and SIEMs when large-scale enumeration is attempted. By operating low-and-slow and blending into the legitimate app’s traffic patterns, a motivated attacker can nonetheless build a detailed picture of accounts, permission groups, and cloud services within the target Slack tenant from this initial access position."

Rate limiting remains the main practical constraint, requiring low-and-slow enumeration patterns. The Cloud Service Dashboard technique is not achievable from this starting point, since it presumes the attacker can sign into Slack’s own web/admin dashboards with user credentials, which this initial access vector does not provide."

In short, this initial access vector is impactful for *execution* (it lets the attacker cause workflows to run inside Slack) but yields only very thin discovery: confirmation of one automation entry point and its basic behavior, with no meaningful visibility into users, channels, groups, or tenant security posture."

        "summary": "From the foothold of an external Slack account in one or more Slack Connect shared channels/DMs, an attacker can perform several realistic Discovery activities without additional compromise of the target organization.\n\nThey can conduct Account Discovery by enumerating all visible participants in shared spaces, inspecting profiles, and using search to identify historical and less active internal users. Through careful observation of channel behavior, documentation, workflow messages, and group-like mentions, they can infer permission and role groups (e.g., admins, security, legal, vendor management), approximating Permission Groups Discovery without direct admin/API access.\n\nBy watching integration cards, link unfurls, and workflow messages, the attacker can perform Cloud Service Discovery, building a catalog of the third-party SaaS and cloud platforms (e.g., CRM, ticketing, document storage, CI/CD, monitoring, identity) that the target integrates with Slack in the context of the shared engagement. Observing retention behavior, the use of Slack AI and enterprise search, and any shared security/compliance materials allows the attacker to infer aspects of the target’s Slack plan level and governance posture (e.g., presence of SSO/SCIM, advanced retention, legal holds, EKM, and audit logging).  Workflow and process-related artifacts (workflows, canvases, lists, AI-agent summaries) expose how key operational processes function and which teams and tools they involve.\n\nFinally, by leveraging the trusted relationship and standard security questionnaires, the attacker can elicit high-level password and authentication policy information (Password Policy Discovery), clarifying whether Slack is SSO-only, how MFA is enforced, and what password rules apply in connected systems. Environment-wide constraints like SSO-only authentication, domain-based registration, MFA, and admin approvals prevent the attacker from escalating this foothold into direct dashboard or admin-console access, making a full Cloud Service Dashboard-style enumeration infeasible from this initial access. The effective discovery surface is therefore all information that legitimately appears in the shared Slack Connect conversation and its attached artifacts, plus what internal stakeholders are willing to disclose in that context."

        "summary": "From the foothold of a malicious, consent-phished Slack app with OAuth tokens, an attacker can realistically perform several powerful Discovery techniques entirely via Slack’s documented APIs and surfaces. Using account-discovery style calls, they can enumerate nearly all workspace users and classify likely admins and executives. By abusing conversations and membership APIs, they can reconstruct the effective permission structure of the tenant—mapping public vs private channels, high-sensitivity groups, and how users are grouped into functional teams. Building on this, they can identify which channels are Slack Connect shared channels, derive a graph of external organizations and partner domains, and see which internal teams interact with each partner, effectively mapping the organization’s external collaboration surface.\n\nBy mining recent message metadata and app cards in key channels, the attacker can discover which Slack apps, bots, and AI agents (including Agentforce-style agents) are active, and—using public Marketplace information—learn which external SaaS platforms and internal systems those integrations connect to. Separately, by listing files and other content surfaces (canvases, lists) and correlating them with channels, they can locate where large volumes of documents and long-lived documentation reside, identifying data-rich and sensitive areas of the workspace without yet exfiltrating contents.\n\nEnvironment-level constraints such as MFA, SSO-only login, CAPTCHA, and Admin Approval for apps primarily impacted initial access, not these API-driven discovery steps; the attacker already has valid tokens. The main remaining constraints are Slack’s Web API rate limits, the scopes originally granted to the app, and any IP allowlisting. These can be managed with low-and-slow enumeration and by keeping API usage aligned with the app’s plausible feature set. In contrast, discovery techniques that rely on viewing password policies or interactive cloud service dashboards (such as Slack admin UIs or AWS EKM consoles) are not achievable from this foothold, since app tokens cannot be used to access those dashboards and no human admin credentials have been compromised."

In this scenario, the attacker only has a stolen Slack OAuth or CLI service token representing an app or service identity, not an authenticated human admin session. Slack’s documented capabilities do not indicate any way to reuse an app token as a browser session credential for the Slack admin UI. SSO-only and MFA requirements for human admins further block console access without valid user credentials and second factors. Therefore, from the current access level, the attacker cannot realistically use Slack’s web admin dashboard as an interactive discovery surface; they are limited to API-based discovery vectors described above."

At a minimum, typical bot-level scopes allow enumeration of users, bots, channels, and Slack Connect relationships, and observation of workflows and integrations active in channels where the app operates. If the compromised token belongs to a more privileged internal tool (for example, one with SCIM, admin.*, or audit scopes), the attacker can escalate discovery to an org-wide perspective: listing all accounts and permission groups, mapping admins and governance roles, cataloging installed apps, workflows, external integrations, and partner organizations, and reconstructing security posture including retention, exports, EKM usage, and audit/logging coverage.\n\nEnvironmental controls such as IP Allowlisting and API rate limiting shape how this enumeration must be performed but do not prevent it once a valid token on an allowlisted IP is in hand. MFA, SSO-only authentication, domain-based registration, and CAPTCHA/email-verification requirements mainly protect interactive user logins and do not directly constrain use of already-issued OAuth or CLI tokens. As a result, the principal defenses against these discovery vectors are strong app-governance practices (limiting scopes and approvals), tight control of high-privilege admin and audit integrations, and monitoring for unusual but still-legitimate API usage patterns from app identities."

After compromise, the main practical constraints on discovery are API rate limits and app-approval workflows, which can be mitigated through low-and-slow enumeration, reuse of existing privileged apps and tokens, and reliance on built-in admin dashboards and exports. Collectively, these vectors give a determined attacker a rich, multi-faceted understanding of the Slack environment, its users, privilege structures, external connections, and security controls without leaving the Slack application boundary."

This reveals many internal users, key participants, and external collaborators but is constrained to the compromised user’s own memberships.\n\nIf the compromised account has admin or org-level rights, Discovery becomes much deeper. Using member-management UIs, exports, and (optionally) admin/SCIM APIs, the attacker can build a near-complete inventory of Slack cloud accounts, determine which identities hold high-privilege roles, and map cloud groups and permission groupings (Cloud Account and Cloud Groups). By inspecting authentication and security configuration, they can also understand the tenant’s effective password and authentication posture—SSO-only vs mixed auth, MFA requirements, SCIM provisioning, and related environmental controls (Password Policy Discovery).\n\nFinally, by traversing admin governance pages, app directories, Slack Connect settings, compliance/EKM/export surfaces, and enterprise search/AI features, the attacker can enumerate which Slack services and external SaaS integrations are in use, how apps and external domains are governed, which logging and audit services are enabled, and whether advanced controls like EKM and legal holds are deployed (Cloud Service Discovery). Environmental constraints such as MFA, SSO-only authentication, IP allowlisting, and rate limiting primarily affect new logins and high-volume scripted API use; they do little to restrict in-session, UI-driven reconnaissance, though they do increase the detection surface via extensive logging and Audit Logs records.\n\nTaken together, these vectors give a motivated attacker with valid Slack credentials a comprehensive understanding of who exists in the Slack tenant, how they are grouped and privileged, which cloud services and integrations surround Slack, and how tightly those are governed—all without needing to step outside Slack’s documented capabilities."
