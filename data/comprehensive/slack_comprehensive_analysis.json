The main crown jewels exposed through these vectors are internal conversations (channels and DMs), shared files and canvases, enterprise search/AI context, and, for governance integrations, comprehensive audit and legal‑hold datasets that reflect the organization’s entire Slack usage history."

Admin dashboards act as a cloud service dashboard, giving quick, high-level insight into tenant size, external collaboration, app footprint, and security posture without heavy API use. Environmental constraints like MFA, SSO-only authentication, IP allowlisting, and rate limiting significantly raise the bar for initial compromise and high-volume automation, but once an attacker controls an appropriate user or admin account, all of the described discovery vectors are realistically achievable with Slack’s documented capabilities."

    "summary": "Within Slack, realistic execution vectors map to two MITRE SaaS Execution techniques: Cloud API and Serverless Execution.\n\n1) Cloud API (standard app tokens): By controlling or compromising a Slack app that holds OAuth tokens, an adversary can run arbitrary code on their own infrastructure in response to Events API and Interactivity payloads, then issue Web API commands (chat.*, conversations.*, streaming, assistant.*) against the workspace. This enables automated posting, reading, and manipulation of channels/DMs and is the primary way to programmatically drive Slack’s core surfaces.\n\n2) Cloud API (privileged Admin/SCIM/Audit/Legal Holds APIs): With admin-level tokens or SCIM credentials, the same Cloud API pattern extends to high-privilege operations. Attackers can execute scripted org-wide commands to manage users, channels, workflows, and app approvals, pull Audit Logs and oversight-visible content, and manipulate legal holds and exports. This turns Slack’s administrative plane into a programmable control surface over the organization’s communications and governance data.\n\n3) Serverless Execution via Slack-hosted Deno Slack SDK apps: Slack-hosted Deno apps run attacker-defined functions in Slack’s managed runtime when triggers (events, schedules, webhooks, slash commands) fire. This mirrors malicious Lambda-style serverless execution, with Slack executing Deno code that can call Web APIs and external services without the attacker running any servers.\n\n4) Serverless Execution via Workflow Builder and connectors: Workflow Builder acts as a no-code serverless environment. An attacker with workflow-author permissions can define event- or schedule-triggered workflows that automatically perform Slack actions and call third-party connectors. Once enabled, these workflows run inside Slack’s automation engine, continuously manipulating or routing data with no further attacker presence required.\n\nEnvironment-level constraints (MFA, SSO-only auth, domain-based registration, admin approval for users, IP allowlisting, and rate limiting) primarily raise the bar for obtaining the identities and app/workflow authoring rights used in these vectors. They do not prevent execution once a valid app token, admin token, or workflow configuration exists. Consequently, the most critical defenses for Slack execution risk are tight app governance and review, strict control of admin and SCIM integrations, and strong oversight of Workflow Builder usage and Slack-hosted apps, especially in channels and workspaces containing executive and highly sensitive communications."

    "summary": "Slack’s design as a programmable collaboration hub exposes multiple, realistic persistence mechanisms for an attacker who has already obtained some level of access:\n\n- **Malicious or hijacked apps/AI agents (Cloud Application Integration)** can be installed once and granted broad, often admin-level scopes. Slack’s OAuth tokens do not expire by default and scopes are additive, so a compromised app’s bot/admin tokens plus Events API subscriptions provide long-lived, low-friction access to messages, files, and admin APIs until the app is explicitly uninstalled or tokens are revoked.\n\n- **Persistent workflows and event-triggered automations (Event Triggered Execution)** created via Workflow Builder or app-based triggers will run indefinitely on schedules or in response to events, even if the originating user is inactive. These workflows can quietly monitor sensitive channels and feed data to attacker-controlled destinations via existing connectors or apps.\n\n- **Covert Slack accounts (Create Account)** can be created via the admin UI or SCIM and then added to sensitive channels and admin groups. When disguised as service or automation users and operated sparingly, such accounts provide durable, interactive access, especially in environments where SCIM misconfiguration leaves lingering or over-privileged users.\n\n- **Expanded admin roles and admin integrations (Additional Cloud Roles)** allow an attacker to silently grant Workspace/Org admin privileges to low-profile accounts and admin-focused apps. These elevated identities can manage users, channels, workflows, app approvals, and Slack Connect, ensuring that even if one admin is remediated, others under attacker control can re-establish or maintain access.\n\n- **Continued use of compromised Slack cloud accounts and tokens (Cloud Accounts)**—including internal users/admins, third-party admin integrations, and external Slack Connect users—gives attackers a straightforward persistence path. Non-expiring OAuth tokens and durable Slack Connect shared channels mean that, without explicit revocation or deprovisioning, these accounts can continue accessing internal conversations and admin interfaces over long periods.\n\nEnvironmental constraints like **MFA, SSO-only auth, domain-based registration, IP allowlisting, rate limiting, and admin approvals** primarily raise the bar for initial compromise and interactive use of human accounts. They do far less to constrain persistence mechanisms that rely on:\n\n- non-expiring OAuth tokens for apps and admin integrations,\n- Slack’s own automation engine (workflows and triggers), and\n- cross-tenant Slack Connect relationships.\n\nEffective mitigation therefore requires not only strong identity controls but also tight app governance, regular audits of workflows and admin roles, continuous monitoring of Audit Logs/API usage, and periodic reviews of Slack Connect relationships and high-privilege integrations."

    "summary": "Slack’s privilege-escalation surface is dominated by its identity and administration layers rather than low-level exploits. The most powerful vectors all revolve around:\n\n- **Role and group management via SCIM and Admin APIs (Additional Cloud Roles)** – If an attacker controls SCIM credentials or admin.* tokens, they can assign Workspace/Org Admin or Owner roles to attacker-controlled users, converting low-priv identities into full administrators. This in turn unlocks exports, legal holds, oversight APIs, and org-wide configuration control.\n\n- **Over-scoped or escalated OAuth tokens for apps (Additional Cloud Credentials)** – By evolving a seemingly-benign internal or Marketplace app into one with admin.*, SCIM, Audit Logs, and Legal Holds scopes, an attacker can turn that app into an additional privileged cloud credential. These tokens often outlive any one human user and give broad, API-driven access to Slack crown jewels.\n\n- **Manipulating memberships and account attributes (Account Manipulation)** – Once some admin capability is obtained, quietly adding attacker-controlled accounts into high-value private channels, adjusting account types, and weakening Slack Connect restrictions creates practical privilege escalation: direct access to executive, legal, and incident-response conversations and files without necessarily changing visible ‘admin’ labels.\n\n- **Abusing privileged automation (Event Triggered Execution)** – High-priv workflows, admin apps, and AI agents can be modified so that, when triggered by normal events or schedules, they execute admin.* or SCIM operations on the attacker’s behalf. These event-driven paths can auto-add admins, approve apps, or adjust memberships, making them potent but subtle escalation channels.\n\n- **Use of compromised admin cloud accounts (Cloud Accounts)** – A stolen Org/Workspace Admin or Owner identity acts as a master key: once authenticated through SSO+MFA, it can create more admins, approve privileged apps, and orchestrate exports, legal holds, and oversight queries. Slack’s own capabilities faithfully enforce whatever this cloud account is allowed to do.\n\nEnvironment constraints like **MFA, SSO-only authentication, domain-based registration, admin approval for new accounts/apps, IP allowlisting, and rate limiting** raise the bar for obtaining the necessary tokens and identities, but they do not prevent escalation once those credentials are compromised or over-granted. Slack’s true crown jewels—complete message and file history (including private channels and DMs via oversight/export), audit logs, legal-hold preserved content, and control over encryption access via EKM—are all directly reachable once an attacker has succeeded with any of the viable vectors above."

An attacker who has already obtained privileged identities or tokens can (1) degrade or subvert logging and monitoring by breaking or filtering Audit Logs API consumers and scheduled exports; (2) manipulate retention, legal holds, and EKM keys so that key periods of message/file history become unreadable or are rapidly purged; (3) operate primarily through OAuth-backed apps, AI agents, and background workflows using application access tokens that bypass MFA and blend into normal integration traffic; (4) rely on legitimate-looking cloud accounts and masqueraded names for users, bots, and agents to hide malicious actions behind trusted-seeming identities; (5) use impersonation via channels/DMs to socially legitimize suspicious changes and delay response; and (6) adjust MFA/SSO enforcement around Slack-related admin accounts to keep those footholds usable without drawing attention via repeated authentication challenges. Environment-wide constraints like MFA, SSO-only auth, IP allowlisting, and registration controls significantly raise the bar for initial compromise but, once bypassed, do not prevent these Slack-native defense evasion behaviors."

However, once any Slack account or app token is compromised, those same constraints do little to prevent credential harvesting via the Slack capabilities described above.\n\nOverall, the primary \"crown jewels\" from a credential-access perspective are (1) Slack OAuth/admin/SCIM/CLI tokens themselves, which grant powerful API-based access to Slack, and (2) the many non-Slack credentials users store in Slack content (cloud keys, database passwords, OAuth client secrets, SSH keys), which can be mined via APIs, exports, workflows, and AI agents to enable compromise of other critical systems."

Techniques like Taint Shared Content and Software Deployment Tools are not supported by Slack’s documented capabilities and do not constitute realistic Slack-native lateral movement vectors. Collectively, the achievable vectors primarily threaten crown jewels such as executive and incident channels, sensitive DMs, shared files, and data in integrated SaaS platforms (e.g., CRM, document stores) that are surfaced or orchestrated through Slack."

At the low end, a compromised user can mine channels, DMs, and Slack Connect spaces via the normal UI and search/Slack AI features, harvesting chat logs, incident-response chatter, and attachments—precisely the behavior documented in the Messaging Applications technique. At the governance layer, compromised admins can abuse data exports, legal holds, and oversight/Audit Logs APIs to pull large, structured archives of Slack communications and metadata from the platform as an information repository. Platform-level integrations, particularly OAuth apps and Workflow Builder automations, enable fully automated, continuous collection of messages, files, and identity data via Web, Events, Admin, and SCIM APIs. Finally, Slack’s role as cloud file storage allows targeted harvesting of uploaded documents and exports, treating Slack much like an object store. Environmental controls such as MFA, SSO-only authentication, IP allowlisting, and API rate limiting constrain how these vectors can be used but do not fundamentally prevent them once a valid identity or app token has been compromised or misused."

An attacker with a compromised account or app token can use standard channels and DMs plus the Web API to run HTTPS-based C2 between malware and Slack. Malicious or compromised apps can receive Events API and interactivity callbacks and respond via Web API calls, forming a full duplex web-protocol C2 channel between Slack and attacker infrastructure. Workflow Builder with webhook triggers allows external HTTPS requests to drive in-Slack automations, providing another C2 entry point even without custom code. Slack Connect shared channels and DMs create persistent cross-organization paths that attackers can use to coordinate with compromised insiders or bots from an external workspace. Finally, AI-enabled agents and LLM-backed apps can act as autonomous operators that shuttle Slack conversation data to attacker-controlled AI backends and execute actions based on remote instructions. Environmental constraints like MFA, SSO-only auth, IP allowlisting, and admin app-approval workflows increase the difficulty of initial compromise and app installation but do not eliminate these vectors once valid accounts or tokens are under attacker control."

    "summary": "Given Slack’s capabilities and documented APIs, exfiltration is realistically achievable through multiple channels.\n\nThe most powerful vectors are admin-level exports and governance APIs, which can bulk-export organization-wide message history and files via self-serve export tools and Discovery APIs to external eDiscovery/DLP platforms (Exfiltration Over Web Service). Admin-focused integrations using the Audit Logs, Admin Oversight, Legal Holds, and SCIM APIs can continuously stream audit data, limited content, and full user/group directories over HTTPS to external SIEMs—providing a rich operational and identity dataset outside Slack’s control.\n\nSlack’s extensible app and workflow platform provides additional high-bandwidth paths: malicious or compromised apps can receive Events API and interactivity payloads (webhook-style pushes) and use the Web API to pull history and files, then forward them to attacker-controlled web services (Exfiltration Over Webhook/Web Service). Workflow Builder allows non-developers to configure connectors that automatically post messages, file links, and form data from channels to external SaaS tools or HTTP endpoints, effectively creating low-code exfiltration pipelines. AI apps and agents, via assistant threads and streaming APIs, can forward concentrated conversation context to external LLM providers, with documented concern about data exfiltration risks.\n\nSlack Connect introduces a cross-tenant replication vector (Transfer Data to Cloud Account): by sharing channels or DMs with an attacker-controlled Slack workspace, sensitive conversations and files are transparently copied into another Slack tenant, where the attacker can further export them. Finally, any compromised user account can exfiltrate data manually by searching for and copying content or downloading files via the UI, or semi-automatically by scripting Web API calls using user or bot tokens (Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol relative to the attacker’s primary C2). Environmental constraints like MFA, SSO-only auth, IP allowlisting, and strict app approvals primarily harden initial compromise and app installation, but once an attacker controls suitable user/admin accounts or tokens, the documented Slack capabilities support multiple realistic, high-impact exfiltration methods."

    "summary": "From a pure Impact perspective, a motivated attacker with control of Slack admin roles or powerful apps can cause severe damage without touching underlying infrastructure. The highest-risk vectors are (1) configuration-driven data destruction (aggressive retention plus legal-hold manipulation), (2) EKM key revocation that instantly renders encrypted content unreadable, (3) subtle but systemic manipulation of Slack-based records and AI-generated summaries, and (4) large-scale account access removal via Admin and SCIM APIs. In addition, Slack’s automation and AI platforms can be hijacked to flood channels/DMs (including Slack Connect) and to drive costly workloads on external services. Environmental constraints like MFA, SSO-only auth, IP allowlisting, and admin approval for apps primarily raise the bar for initial compromise; once high-privilege identities or apps are under attacker control, these constraints do little to prevent the above impact methods."
